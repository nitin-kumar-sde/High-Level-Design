## 🔍 What is HLD?

High-Level Design (HLD) defines the overall architecture and structure of the system — like viewing the system from 10,000 feet above. It focuses on how different subsystems and services interact to achieve business goals, without delving into class-level implementation.

A well-thought HLD ensures your system is scalable, resilient, maintainable, and easy to evolve.

## 🔩 What does HLD comprise?

High-Level Design (HLD) captures the macro architecture — how different components fit together and interact to meet system goals. 

It primarily focuses on the following key areas

- 💼 Component Responsibilities
- 💬 Inter-Component Communication
- 🏛️ Architecture Style
- 🌍 Database & Storage Decisions
- 📺 Caching Strategy
- 🔐 Security Considerations
- 💪 Fault Tolerance & Resilience
- 📈 Scalability and Availabilty
- 🤖 Monitoring & Observability
- 🧭 Deployment & Infrastructure Overview
- ⌛ Testing Strategy at the System Level
