## 🔍 What is HLD?

High-Level Design (HLD) defines the overall architecture and structure of the system — like viewing the system from 10,000 feet above. It focuses on how different subsystems and services interact to achieve business goals, without delving into class-level implementation.

A well-thought HLD ensures your system is scalable, resilient, maintainable, and easy to evolve.

## 🔩 What does HLD comprise?

High-Level Design (HLD) captures the macro architecture — how different components fit together and interact to meet system goals. 

It primarily focuses on the following key areas

- 💼 Component Responsibilities
- 💬 Inter-Component Communication
- 🏛️ Architecture Style
- 🌍 Database & Storage Decisions
- 📺 Caching Strategy
- 🔐 Security Considerations
- 💪 Fault Tolerance & Resilience
- 📈 Scalability and Availabilty
- 🤖 Monitoring & Observability
- 🧭 Deployment & Infrastructure Overview
- ⌛ Testing Strategy at the System Level

## 🛠 Asynchronous Processing 

In high-performance, distributed systems, **asynchronous processing** is a foundational pattern that improves **responsiveness**, **scalability**, and **fault isolation** by offloading non-critical or time-intensive operations to background workflows.

Instead of executing every task inline (synchronously), asynchronous systems **defer certain tasks**, allowing the system to respond immediately and handle deferred work independently.

### 🧠 Common Use Cases

- **🎥 Time-Intensive Tasks** - Used when operations take too long to complete inline (e.g., file processing, ML inference).

- **🤖 Background Jobs** - For tasks that don’t require immediate user feedback (e.g., sending emails, notifications).

- **⌛ Load Buffering** - Helps absorb high traffic spikes and smooth load before hitting downstream systems.

- **⚛︎ Service Decoupling** - Allows independent scaling, deployment, and failure isolation between producers and consumers.


### 💌 Message Queues / Brokers

A **Message Queue** (or **Message Broker**) is a system component that enables **asynchronous communication** between decoupled services by allowing messages to be placed in a queue by producers and consumed by consumers at their own pace.

This decoupling ensures that services remain **resilient**, **scalable**, and **non-blocking**, especially under heavy load or varying processing speeds.

#### ♻️ When to Use 

- ⚛ Consumers process messages asynchronously and independently
- 🔗 Decoupling between data producers and consumers
- 📢 For tasks that don’t require immediate action
  
#### 📦 Common Message Brokers

| Broker        | Description                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) | Traditional queue-based system, supports complex routing       |
| [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)| Fully managed, scalable message queue by AWS                |

### 🌊 Message Streams

A **Message Stream** enables continuous, ordered, and real-time flow of data between services. Unlike queues, where messages are removed after consumption, streams retain data for a fixed duration, allowing multiple consumers to independently read messages at their own pace.

#### ♻️ When to Use 

- ⚛ Consumers process messages asynchronously and independently
- 🔗 Multiple consumer groups process messages simultaneously
- 📢 For tasks that don’t require immediate action

  
#### 📦 Common Message Streams
| Stream        | Description                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) | Distributed event streaming platform, supports high-throughput, real-time data pipelines |
| [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) | Managed real-time data streaming service on AWS, ideal for analytics and ingestion |


### 📡 Real-Time Pub/Sub

Real-Time Pub/Sub (Publish–Subscribe) is a communication pattern where senders (publishers) broadcast messages to topics, and receivers (subscribers) get updates instantly, without knowing each other.

It enables loose coupling, scalable fan-out, and real-time delivery, powering systems like chat apps, collaborative editors, live dashboards, and IoT devices.

#### ♻️ When to Use 

- ⚛ Instant updates to multiple consumers (e.g., live feed, multiplayer game)
- 🔗 Decoupling between data producers and consumers
- 📢 Asynchronous communication with minimal delay

#### 📦 Common Message Pub Sub
| Stream        | Description                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Reddis PubSub](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/pubsub/) | Lightweight, in-memory pub/sub system for low-latency, ephemeral message delivery |
| [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) | Fully managed pub/sub service on AWS for real-time event broadcasting to multiple endpoints |
