## 🔍 What is HLD?

High-Level Design (HLD) defines the **overall system architecture**. It focuses on:
- Service interactions
- Component responsibilities
- Scalability & deployment considerations
- External interfaces
- Performance, availability, reliability

🧠 It answers: *How does the system look from 10,000 feet above?*

---

## 🧩 Components of HLD

- System Overview & Use Cases
- Component & Service Diagram
- Data Flow / Sequence Diagrams
- API Interfaces
- Database Design (High-Level)
- Deployment & Scaling Strategy
- Caching, Queues, Security Layers

---

## 🏛️ System Design Fundamentals

- Functional vs Non-functional requirements
- Latency, throughput, availability
